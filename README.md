# EEG-Data-Preprocessing
This Repo contains the code for preprocessing EEG data for training and evaluating Deep Learning models.

# Things To Note
1. The EEG recordings are segmented by time only.
2. Minimal denoising and filtering of EEG signals.
3. Raw EEG data are extracted with international 10 - 20 standards format.
4. There is no features engineering.
